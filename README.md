# GAFutoshiki
Computational Intelligence class project
wrote a genetic algorithm to solve Futoshiki Puzzles

program reads txt files in the following format:
set numbers file name: namen.txt
logic operators file name: namel.txt

input file name as: name
the program will append on the "n.txt" and "l.txt" by itself

max generations is the number of generations the program will go through before restarting and creating a brand new population
as a general rule, set max generations to:
50 for 3x3 puzzles
300 for 4x4 puzzles
300-500 for 5x5 puzzles
